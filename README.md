# Rainfall Analysis Project ðŸŒ§ðŸ“ˆ

This project involves the analysis of monthly rainfall data to explore patterns and trends, utilizing R programming. The primary focus is to perform time-series decomposition, compare climatological patterns, and evaluate trend and seasonal signals.

## Introduction
Understanding rainfall patterns is essential for weather forecasting, agriculture planning, and water resource management. This project uses historical rainfall data to analyze and predict patterns, helping to uncover potential trends and seasonal variations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains daily rainfall data from 1970 to 2024, which is aggregated to create monthly values for analysis. The parameters include:
- Date
- Rainfall amount (mm)

## Objective
- To aggregate daily rainfall data into monthly averages.
- To analyze time-series data by identifying trends, seasonality, and noise.
- To compare climatological patterns and identify shifts over the period.
- To evaluate trend and seasonal signals to understand long-term patterns.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Aggregating daily rainfall data into monthly data.
2. Time-Series Decomposition: Breaking down data into trend, seasonal, and residual components using additive models.
3. Climatology and Seasonal Comparison: Analyzing and visualizing seasonal patterns across years.
4. Trend Analysis: Using statistical methods to identify long-term trends.
5. Data Visualization: Creating plots to illustrate findings.

## Tools & Libraries
- R programming / RStudio
- Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, forecast, tseries, zoo, ggplot2, scales, tidyr, ggplottimeseries, urca, tsutils, TSA, lmtest, astsa
